# MyoMusic
DubHacks 2015

MyoMusic uses the Myo armband to reinvent music itself. 
We use the highly accurate 3d motion sensors on the Myo to map sound to the spatial dimension.

Our original intention was to use the Myo's pose-sensing capabilities to invent a gesture-based musical instrument. However, our first attempts suggested that the accuracy of the device's pose-sensing capabilities was not yet refined to the point of being ready for musical performance.
